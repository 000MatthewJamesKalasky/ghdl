This creates two files (or more): `ghdl-ls.in` and `ghdl-ls.out`
Those are raw dumps of the LSP data.

Create a new test directory (increment the number):

> mkdir 099mytest
> cd 099mytest

Transforms those files in json (which are easier to read and to process):

> python3 -m pyGHDL.lsp.lsptools lsp2json < xxx/ghdl-ls.in > cmds.json
> python3 -m pyGHDL.lsp.lsptools lsp2json < xxx/ghdl-ls.out > replies.json

Substitute the root directory with `@ROOT@` (for privacy and relocation):

> sed -i -e 's!/home/me/test!@ROOT@' cmds.json
> sed -i -e 's!/home/me/test!@ROOT@' replies.json

Attention: the uri must ends with a `/` (you will be notified if not)

Add a test in LanguageServer.py (use existing tests as a template)

Adjust or improve this file.
